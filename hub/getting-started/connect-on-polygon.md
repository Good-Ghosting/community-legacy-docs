# Connect on Polygon

We make use of the Polygon 'PoS Chain' to run our Polygon savings challenges.

### What is Polygon? <a href="#what-is-polygon" id="what-is-polygon"></a>

Polygon is a scaling solution for public blockchains, including Ethereum. It allows for user and developers to make use of the available Ethereum tooling (such as MetaMask and smart contracts) along with faster and cheaper transactions.Learn more about Polygon

> Digital tokens can easily be bridged between Polygon and other blockchains. _See_ [_our guides_](getting-cryptocurrency-tokens/)_._
