# Bridges and Exchanges

Gasless swap on Polygon (obtaining MATIC)

First time on Polygon and need MATIC to pay for transactions? Accidentally send all your MATIC out of your wallet? Only have USDC or DAI or other tokens in your Polygon wallet?\
Whatever the reason, this is how you acquire MATIC on Polygon mainnet if you don't have any for gas. Using the [Polygon web wallet](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/gas-swap) 'Swap for gas':

### Swapping tokens in MetaMask directly

Did you know you could swap tokens from within the Metamask app itself? This is often the easiest option, although MetaMask does charge a hefty 0.875% service fee for this.&#x20;
