# Obtaining MATIC, USDC, DAI, WETH and other Polygon tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
To take part in our Genesis savings pool, you will need some [DAI](https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x8f3Cf7ad23Cd3CaDbD9735AFf958023239c6A063/transactions) on [Polygon](../connect-on-polygon.md), as well as a small amount of MATIC on Polygon (PoS mainnet) to pay for transaction fees.
{% endhint %}

## How to obtain DAI on Polygon

_Different options_

1. **Bridge your DAI from Ethereum to Polygon (Proof of Stake)** ðŸŒ‰ \
   If you already have DAI on the Ethereum mainnet, you can to move this over to Polygon (PoS).\
   You can use the official [Matic Wallet bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/), [Jumper Aggregator](https://jumper.exchange/) or the [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?token=DAI\&sourceNetwork=ethereum\&destNetwork=polygon). Here is a [**great written guide**](https://quickswap-layer2.medium.com/how-to-set-up-polygon-matic-mainnet-for-metamask-transfer-assets-from-l1-to-l2-to-use-9a7975eb8769) for the official bridge, as well as a [**YouTube tutorial**](https://youtu.be/jQCXmiwtIQU?t=373).\
   \
   _Note: this will require a transaction on Ethereum mainnet. Depending on the transaction cost (gas fees) of  Ethereum, this only makes sense if you want to transfer relatively large amounts of your existing DAI._ \

2.  **Bridge your DAI from other blockchains to Polygon** ðŸŒ‰ \
    If you already have:

    * DAI on **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**
    * xDAI on the **Gnosis** chain
    * DAI on **Fantom**
    * DAI on **Avalanche**
    * DAI on **Arbitrum**
    * DAI on **Optimism**

    You can use the [Jumper aggregator](https://jumper.exchange/), [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/), [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/send?token=DAI\&destNetwork=polygon) or the [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/) to transfer DAI to Polygon. _See this_ [_external guide_](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/xdai-matic-connext-bridge)_.  Transaction costs will be very low._ \
    \
    Alternatively, you can use a Bridging aggregator like Transferto.xyz or Bungee:

{% embed url="https://transferto.xyz/swap" %}
Bridge assets between 14+ chains
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://www.bungee.exchange/" %}
Bridge assets between 8+ chains
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://celotracker.com/bridge/" %}
Bridge assets between Polygon and Celo
{% endembed %}

**3. Buy DAI directly on Polygon (via a third-party)** ðŸ‘›\
There are multiple service providers that offer the possibility to directly buy DAI on Polygon. \
e.g. [https://ramp.network/buy/](https://ramp.network/buy/) or [https://global.transak.com/](https://global.transak.com/)\
_Make sure to select "DAI on Polygon chain" or "DAI on Polygon network" so you end up with the correct DAI. Most often you can pay by either a Bank Transfer (e.g. SEPA deposit) or a debit or credit card. Transaction fees should be somewhat cheaper compared to transferring DAI from Ethereum._\


> &#x20;:warning: _These are external services - not related to the GoodGhosting project! You will most likely be required to verify your identity and pay a fee for using their service. We'd like to make clear that this is NOT an endorsement or recommendation of any type._ :warning:



**4. Swap on a decentralized exchange on Polygon** ðŸ”„

If you already hold other assets on Polygon (e.g. ETH or MATIC or USDC or another token), you can use the [Quickswap Exchange](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8f3Cf7ad23Cd3CaDbD9735AFf958023239c6A063) or [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/#/?network=polygon) or [Slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/trade/m/GHST) to easily swap them for DAI.\
\
_You will need a very small amount of MATIC to pay for the (negligible) transaction costs._

## How to obtain MATIC on Polygon

Each transaction on Polygon will require a small amount of MATIC tokens in your wallet.

If you purchased MATIC on a centralized exchange (such as Binance, Crypto.com, Okex, OkCoin or Ascendex), you can most likely withdraw it in your own personal wallet on Polygon (e.g. see[ this guide for Binance](https://medium.com/the-polygon-blog/how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-on-polygon-pos-commit-chain-on-binance-76783388d56f)).

If you already hold other digital assets in your wallet on Polygon, you can convert them to MATIC using the [native Polygon web app](https://wallet.polygon.technology/) (without the need for MATIC tokens). See [this guide](../cryptocurrency-wallets.md).\
\
**Luckily, there are three options to obtain free MATIC tokens as well:**

*   **Option 1**

    Solve the CAPTCHA at this **faucet** to obtain 0.001 MATIC.

    * [https://matic.supply/](https://matic.supply/)


* **Option 2**\
  Connect your wallet to the **official Polygon Bridge** at [https://wallet.polygon.technology/](https://wallet.polygon.technology/), and sign the transaction. _This often, but not always, results in you obtaining 0.001 MATIC._ \

* **Option 3**
  * Make sure your wallet holds at least 1 DAI _or USDC or USDT_ on Polygon  (see above)&#x20;
    * Connect your wallet to [https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)
    * In the top right corner press the "CLAIM MATIC" button.\
      _This will give you 0.001 MATIC, if your wallet does not hold any MATIC tokens._\
      _This should be enough to get started._

See this great [YouTube Tutorial ](https://youtu.be/jQCXmiwtIQU?t=750)from The Defiant for more details.

ðŸ‘› Alternatively, you can use one of the third-party fiat onboarding solutions mentioned above.\


## How to obtain WETH on Polygon

When you bridge your Ether to Polygon, it will show up as ['Wrapped Ether'](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619), also known as wETH or WETH. This is the type you will need to enter a GoodGhosting savings pool on Polygon.\
_Often it is simply referred to as ETH._

_Different options to obtain it_

1.  **Bridge your ETH from Ethereum  to Polygon** ðŸŒ‰ \
    If you already have ETH on the Ethereum mainnet, you can to move this over to Polygon.\
    You can use the official [Matic Wallet bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/) or the [Jumper Aggregator](https://jumper.exchange/?fromChain=42161\&toChain=137\&toToken=0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619) or the [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?token=DAI\&sourceNetwork=ethereum\&destNetwork=polygon), as mentioned above. &#x20;

    {% hint style="warning" %}
    Doublecheck you are bridging normal ETH into Polygon. Do **not** bridge the mainnet ['WETH' ERC-20](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) token onto Polygon using the official bridge. _Sadly, that is another type of wrapper which is incompatible with GoodGhosting._
    {% endhint %}
2.  **Bridge your ETH from other blockchains to Polygon** ðŸŒ‰ \
    If you already have:

    * ETH on **Optimism**
    * ETH on **Arbitrum**
    * ETH on **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**
    * WETH on the **xDAI** chain
    * ETH on **Fantom**
    * WETH on **Avalanche**

    \
    You can use the Jumper Aggregator, [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/), [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/send?token=DAI\&destNetwork=polygon) or the [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/) to transfer ETH to Polygon. _See this_ [_external guide_](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/xdai-matic-connext-bridge)_.  Transaction costs will be very low. Note that each bridge may support different chains._\

3. **Buy WETH directly on Polygon (via a third-party)** ðŸ‘›\
   There are multiple service providers that offer the possibility to directly buy DAI on Polygon. \
   e.g. [https://ramp.network/buy/](https://ramp.network/buy/) or [https://global.transak.com/](https://global.transak.com/)\
   _Make sure to select "ETH on Polygon chain" or "WETH on Polygon network" so you end up with the correct token. Most often you can pay by either a Bank Transfer (e.g. SEPA deposit) or a debit or credit card. Transaction fees should be somewhat cheaper compared to transferring ETH from Ethereum._\

4.  &#x20;**Swap on a decentralized exchange on Polygon** ðŸ”„

    If you already hold other assets on Polygon (e.g. DAI or MATIC or USDC or another token), you can use the [Quickswap Exchange](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8f3Cf7ad23Cd3CaDbD9735AFf958023239c6A063) or [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/#/?network=polygon) or [Slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/trade/m/GHST) to easily swap them for WETH.\
    \
    _You will need a very small amount of MATIC to pay for the (negligible) transaction costs._&#x20;

## How to obtain GHST on Polygon

> _GHST is the primary utility token of the Aavegotchi ecosystem and is used to buy and sell goods within the Aavegotchi world, including Aavegotchis themselves._&#x20;

If you purchased GHST on a centralized exchange, such as Crypto.com or OKEx, you can likely withdraw in your own personal wallet on Polygon (e.g. see [this guide for OKEx](https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-polygon-withdrawals-with-okex-bef684d23552)). _Be careful to not withdraw to Ethereum mainnet._\
\
**Three additional options are available to acquire GHST on Polygon:**

* **From a Polygon Decentralized Exchange**\
  GHST can be openly traded on a variety of decentralized exchanges on Polygon. These DEXes have different liquidity so be sure to check your trading price against a few places to find the best deal.
  * [Slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/trade/m/GHST)
  * [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/#/?network=polygon)
  * [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)\

*   **On the Aavegotchi website**

    The Aavegotchi website has an in-house Swapper that can be used to trade for GHST directly on their platform. There are details on additional GHST options as well. We have provided a video guide through this platform as well, [found here](https://youtu.be/9WuJgQfXvnI).

    * [https://app.aavegotchi.com/get-ghst](https://app.aavegotchi.com/get-ghst)\

*   **Bridge from Ethereum to Polygon**

    If you already have the GHST token on the Ethereum mainnet, you can use the Aavegotchi Bridge to cross for the lowest transaction costs possible.
