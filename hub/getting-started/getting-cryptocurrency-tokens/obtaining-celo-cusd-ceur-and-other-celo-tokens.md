# Obtaining CELO, cUSD, cEUR, and other Celo tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
To take part in our Celo Savings Pools, you will need some cUSD, as well as a small amount of CELO to pay for transaction fees. \
\
_At the time of writing, 0.05 CELO is sufficient._
{% endhint %}

## How to obtain CELO

### Acquiring and withdrawing from Centralized Exchange

CELO is listed on several exchanges worldwide, such as [Binance](https://binance.com/), [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com), [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/), [Bittrex](https://global.bittrex.com/), [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/), [Gate.io](https://gate.io), [Upbit](https://upbit.com/) and [OKX](https://www.okx.com/) See the [full list](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/markets/). You should be able to withdraw the CELO into your own personal wallet.

### Buying through our 'Buy Crypto' page (powered by Ramp)

Go to [https://app.halofi.me/#/buy](https://app.halofi.me/#/buy) and start buying and selling CELO in minutes! Use your favorite payment method like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Revolut, credit card or bank transfer via our integration with Ramp. _You can also sell crypto to quickly top up your credit or debit card._

### Use a Gas Station to bypass centralized providers

Tools like [https://o3swap.com/gas-station](https://o3swap.com/gas-station) or [Via Router (Refuel)](https://router.via.exchange/) can be used to swap an asset on Polygon, for CELO tokens on Celo. This will get you the gas required to pay transaction fees on the Celo chain. This way you can bypass centralized exchanges.

## How to obtain cUSD/cEUR/cREAL on Celo

_Different options_

1.  **Buy, or mint, directly** on Celo via a third-party&#x20;

    There are multiple service providers that offer the possibility to directly buy Celo network stablecoins into your wallet. For example:

    * [https://ramp.network/buy/](https://ramp.network/buy/)
    * [https://global.transak.com/](https://global.transak.com/)&#x20;
    * [https://www.moonpay.com/](https://www.moonpay.com/)
    * [https://valoraapp.com/](https://valoraapp.com/)&#x20;
    * [https://mento.finance/](https://mento.finance/)

    _Make sure to select the 'Celo Network'. Most often you can pay by either a Bank Transfer (e.g. SEPA deposit) or a debit or credit card._ &#x20;

    _‚ö†Ô∏è These are external services - not related to the GoodGhosting project! You will most likely be required to verify your identity and pay a fee for using their service. We'd like to make clear that this is NOT an endorsement or recommendation of any type. ‚ö†Ô∏è_ \

2.  **Withdraw from a centralized exchange**&#x20;

    cUSD is listed on several exchanges worldwide, such as [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/), [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/), [Bittrex](https://global.bittrex.com/) and [Okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/). See the full list [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celo-dollar#markets). You should be able to withdraw the cUSD into your own personal [wallet](../cryptocurrency-wallets.md).\
    _cEUR and cREAL are yet only available on a handful of centralized exchanges._


3.  **Bridge tokens from Polygon/Ethereum/Solana/...** to Celo üåâ **and swap** into cUSD.

    \
    If you already hold digital tokens on Polygon, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB, Solana or other chains, you can move them to Celo.

    \
    You can use the [O3 Swap bridge](https://o3swap.com/swap?src\_chain=137\&dst\_chain=42220\&src\_token\_hash=0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a) or [Celo Tracker](https://celotracker.com/bridge/) to go **directly from USDC on Polygon, to cUSD on Celo.** Alternatively, you can use the official [Wormhole](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/) bridge (preferred) or [Optics](https://optics.app/) bridges.  &#x20;
4. You can use the [O3 Swap bridge](https://o3swap.com/swap?src\_chain=137\&dst\_chain=42220\&src\_token\_hash=0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a) or [Celo Tracker](https://celotracker.com/bridge/) to go **directly from USDC on Polygon, to cUSD on Celo.** Alternatively, you can use the official [Wormhole](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/) bridge (preferred) or [Optics](https://optics.app/) bridges.  &#x20;

_After bridging you will often have to swap the bridged token into cUSD._ \
_And then swap the bridged assets through_ [_Mobius_](https://www.mobius.money/#/swap)_,_ [_Uniswap_](https://uniswap.exchange/swap) _or_ [_CeloTracker_](https://celotracker.com/swap/)_. See next option._\
\
\
4\. **Swap on a decentralized exchange on Celo**  üîÑ&#x20;

If you already hold other assets on Celo (e.g. CELO or cUSDC or USDCet or cETH or pUDSC or another token), you can use the [Mobius](https://www.mobius.money/#/swap), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/swap), or [CeloTracker](https://celotracker.com/swap/) exchanges to easily swap them for cUSD.   _You will need a very small amount of CELO to pay for the (negligible) transaction costs._

## How to obtain CELO-ETHIX LP tokens

Our [EthicHub pool](https://medium.com/goodghosting/ethichub-savings-pool-on-goodghosting-16656fd716ce) uses ETHIX-CELO LP tokens_,_ which can be acquired [here](https://celo.symm.fi/#/pool/0xad2f9f4cd2ae4f2dd2841eb1ea7e162fb4767d4d000200000000000000000033) on the Symmetric exchange.
