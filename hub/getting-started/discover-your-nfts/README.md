# Discover Your NFTs

With HaloFi you can earn unique NFTs, when completing a savings challenge. These NFTs will give you voting power on our [Snapshot page](https://vote.halofi.me/), and are available to trade on platforms like OpenSea or TofuNFT.

{% hint style="info" %}
NFTs (or "Non-Fungible Tokens") are a type of cryptoasset that provide a unique way to represent ownership of digital assets. Unlike "fungible" assets such as Bitcoin and dollar bills, which are interchangeable and have equal value, each NFT is unique and has its own specific value. NFTs are stored on a blockchain, which provides a decentralized and secure way to track ownership and transaction history.

### I completed a challenge. Where is the NFT?

Congratulations! You've successfully completed a HaloFi DeFi savings challenge and took a step towards a better financial future! üéâüëè

Withdrawing your savings from a challenge is straightforward, but locating your NFT reward might be a bit more elusive. Whether you're a [Polygon](broken-reference) or a [Celo](broken-reference) saver, we offer step-by-step instructions for both easy and in-depth discovery methods.\
\
**In general, the easiest way to view NFTs is with a marketplace like** [**TofuNFT**](https://tofunft.com/)**.** This platform provides crosschain NFT visibility simply. Easily list, view and purchase NFTs across multiple different blockchains.
