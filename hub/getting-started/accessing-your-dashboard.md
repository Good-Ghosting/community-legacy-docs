Besides always finding a new challenge to join, you will see your [Halo Hero Avatar](../../halofi-challenges/halofi-heroes-levels-and-gg-score.md) and it's current Level.

At the bottom of the page, in the Challenge Cards, you can keep track of upcoming actions. Giving you a birdâ€™s eye view of your upcoming deposits and withdrawals. Youâ€™ll now know exactly how many days are left until you can celebrate your winnings! ðŸŽ‰
