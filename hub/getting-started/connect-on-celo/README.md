<summary>Learn more about Celo</summary>

Celo is a proof-of-stake blockchain. In comparison to Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this means that users can make transactions that are cheaper, faster, and whose outcome cannot be changed once complete. Celo is EVM-compatible and environmentally friendly. _To learn more about Celo click_ [_here_](https://celo.org/about) _or_ [_here_](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-celo)_._&#x20;

</details>

> Digital tokens can easily be bridged between Celo and other blockchains. _See_ [_our guides_](../getting-cryptocurrency-tokens/)_._&#x20;

We advise to select 'MetaMask' if you are accessing the website from a laptop or desktop. For mobile users, we recommend to use either Coinbase Wallet or Valora.

_Great, you're almost there! You can skip to_ [_this step_](../../../halofi-challenges/join-and-complete-a-challenge.md)_, unless you'd like to learn about Valora connections as well._

</details>

<details>

<summary>Alternatively, connect your Valora wallet</summary>

I‌f you rather use a Mobile wallet like Valora, you can select that one from the list, and follow the steps in this short video:

<details>

<summary>Switching your wallet to the Celo network</summary>

In case your wallet is still connected to another network (e.g. Ethereum, Polygon or BSC), you will be asked to change the network in your wallet.\
\
Either click on the 'Change network' button&#x20;

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/switch-to-polygon-network.png" alt="" data-size="original">

or confirm the automatic prompt:

_Note that some wallets, like Frame and Rabby, automatically switch networks._\
\
Alternatively, you can use [this tool](https://chainlist.org/?search=celo) (Chainlist) to set up your wallet for Celo.

</details>



You will see your wallet is connected, in the top right corner.
